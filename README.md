### Hi there, I'm Tijm ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 16-year-old Software Engineer, I'm a high school dropout because of my autism. I've since then started to teach myself how to code. I pick skills up quickly and am able to take a lot of knowledge in, giving me the ability to work on many different kinds of projects. I'm currently working at IXON Cloud as a Front-End Developer.

#### ðŸ’» Working on
Multiple personal and work projects, using many tools and languages.
My skills range from Web Development with Angular, Typescript and the firebase suite, Mobile iOS and Android deployment with Fastlane, to improving automation with Python, Docker and Node.js

#### ðŸ§  Wanting to learn
Some of the things I'd like to learn include a low level programming language, a non object oriented language, and some more Web development frameworks, like Vue, Svelte or React.
